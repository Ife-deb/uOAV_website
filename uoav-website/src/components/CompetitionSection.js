            The Autonomous Snowplow Competition has been taking place in Minnesota since 2010 and invites teams to autonomously clear a snowfield while avoiding obstacles and then navigating back to the starting garage. The competition encourages teams to use state-of-the-art sensors and navigation technology to accurately and safely clear a snow path.
